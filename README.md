This a repository conatining the appedix for my project thesis

==========================

- Results folder contains all the raw data collected as .csv files.
- NMSIS folder contains a customized version of NMSIS that is made for compatibility with MLonMCU. It has been made by replacing the muRISCV-NN code with code from the NMSIS-NN repository. I have not written any of the code myself, only adapted it from the other two repositories.
- The python script can be tuned and customized to dispatch MLonMCU simulations, this is adapted from the main MLonMCU repository.
